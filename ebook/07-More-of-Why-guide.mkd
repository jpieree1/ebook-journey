I'm still reading Why guide to Ruby. This is quite a long book, with funny
stories in it. I'm also testing some of his example in `irb` or in a `.rb` file
along the way. This takes me a longer time that I expected. I still have one or
two more chapters to go until the end, I'm eager to start learning more abour
Rails and start some real Ruby coding to practice a bit.
